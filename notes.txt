/* insomnia - meant to do things we could do in JS or command line.
is a sandbox to send requests to API. Practice here first. 
internet of things - where you can connect to things like location sensors, 
weather sensors, etc. 
dropped API end-point in insomnia - the url
add ID to url - in insomnia
blah blah don't know what happened - see slack message
fetch takes a url, look at structure of url and see where 
to put a template literal (changing ids)*/

// GET = show us some data from your database 
// .then = wait until there's a response
// return response.json() - computer reads it/parses it
// .response - whatever you get from code immediately before it

 // To think about
 // 1. dropdowns for .currencyAbb
 // 2. adding flags if possible
 // 3. giving info about country? 
 // 4. how you can write in the amount box and it also changes the box below it
 // 5. how to make equation 1 blah = 1 blah based on countries you've chosen . exchangeEquation

 //advice from readme
 //look at documentation for API!!!
 //"content-type": "application.json" is what we will be using for now
